## Solution

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 
vector<int> rotateArray(vector<int>& arr, int n) {
    // Store the first element of the array in a temporary variable
    int temp = arr[0];

    // Shift all elements of the array to the left by one position
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
    }

    // Place the first element (stored in temp) at the end of the array
    arr[n - 1] = temp;

    // Return the modified array
    return arr;
}
```

## Explanation

The problem requires left-rotating an array by one position. This means that every element of the array should shift one position to the left, and the first element should move to the last position. The solution follows these steps:

1. **Store the First Element**:
   - Save the first element of the array (`arr[0]`) in a temporary variable `temp` because it will be overwritten in the next step.

2. **Shift Elements**:
   - Iterate through the array starting from the first element and shift each element to the left by one position. This is done by assigning the value of `arr[i + 1]` to `arr[i]`.

3. **Move the First Element to Last**:
   - After the loop completes, assign the value stored in `temp` (which was the original first element) to the last position of the array (`arr[n - 1]`).

4. **Return the Array**:
   - The modified array is returned as the result.

## Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: The solution requires one pass through the array, so the time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the array `n`.

## Space Complexity

- **O(1)**: The solution uses only a constant amount of extra space for the temporary variable `temp`, so the space complexity is constant.
