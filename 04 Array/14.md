## Solution

```cpp
#include <map>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

std::string read(int n, std::vector<int> book, int target) {
    std::map<int, int> mpp; // Map to store elements and their indices

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int a = book[i]; // Current element
        int more = target - a; // Element needed to reach the target

        // Check if the required element exists in the map
        if (mpp.find(more) != mpp.end()) {
            return "YES"; // Pair found
        }
        
        // Store the current element in the map
        mpp[a] = i;
    }

    return "NO"; // No pair found
}
```

## Explanation

The problem requires checking if there are two numbers in an array that add up to a given target sum. The solution uses a hash map to efficiently find the required pair:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a `map` (hash map) named `mpp` to store the elements of the array and their indices.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Traverse through the array.
   - For each element `a`, compute `more` as `target - a`, which is the number needed to reach the target sum with the current element `a`.
   - Check if `more` is present in the map:
     - If it is, return `"YES"` because a pair that sums up to the target has been found.
     - If not, add the current element `a` to the map with its index.

3. **Return**:
   - If the loop completes without finding a pair, return `"NO"`.

## Time Complexity

- **O(N)**: The solution involves a single pass through the array, where `N` is the size of the array. Each lookup and insertion operation in the map is O(1) on average.

## Space Complexity

- **O(N)**: The space complexity is determined by the size of the map, which can grow up to `N` elements in the worst case.
