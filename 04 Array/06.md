## Solution

```cpp
vector<int> rotateArray(vector<int> arr, int k) {
    int n = arr.size();
    k = k % n; // Handle cases where k is greater than n

    // Store the first k elements in a temporary array
    int temp[k];
    for(int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        temp[i] = arr[i];
    }

    // Shift the remaining elements of the array to the left by k positions
    for(int i = k; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i - k] = arr[i];
    }

    // Place the elements from the temporary array at the end of the original array
    for(int i = n - k; i < n; i++) {
        arr[i] = temp[i - (n - k)];
    }

    return arr;
}
```

## Explanation

The problem requires rotating an array by `k` positions. This means that the first `k` elements of the array should move to the end, and the remaining elements should shift to the left. The solution follows these steps:

1. **Handling Large `k` Values**:
   - First, we take `k = k % n` to handle cases where `k` is greater than `n` (the size of the array). This reduces unnecessary rotations.

2. **Store the First `k` Elements**:
   - We store the first `k` elements of the array in a temporary array `temp`.

3. **Shift Elements**:
   - We then shift the remaining elements of the array to the left by `k` positions. This is done by assigning the value of `arr[i]` to `arr[i - k]`.

4. **Move the First `k` Elements to the End**:
   - Finally, we place the elements from the temporary array `temp` at the end of the array.

5. **Return the Array**:
   - The modified array is returned as the result.

## Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: The solution requires passing through the array twice, so the time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the array `n`.

## Space Complexity

- **O(k)**: The solution uses an extra array `temp` of size `k`, so the space complexity is proportional to `k`.
