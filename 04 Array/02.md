## Solution

```cpp
int secondLargest(vector<int> a, int n) {
    int largest = a[0];
    int slargest = -1; // Initialize second largest as -1
    
    // Iterate through the array to find the largest and second largest elements
    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if(a[i] > largest) {
            slargest = largest; // Update second largest
            largest = a[i]; // Update largest
        }
        else if(a[i] < largest && a[i] > slargest) {
            slargest = a[i]; // Update second largest if it's between largest and previous second largest
        }
    }
    return slargest; // Return the second largest element
}

int secondSmallest(vector<int> a, int n) {
    int smallest = a[0];
    int ssmallest = INT_MAX; // Initialize second smallest as the maximum integer value
    
    // Iterate through the array to find the smallest and second smallest elements
    for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if(a[i] < smallest) {
            ssmallest = smallest; // Update second smallest
            smallest = a[i]; // Update smallest
        }
        else if (a[i] != smallest && a[i] < ssmallest) {
            ssmallest = a[i]; // Update second smallest if it's between smallest and previous second smallest
        }
    }
    return ssmallest; // Return the second smallest element
}

vector<int> getSecondOrderElements(int n, vector<int> a) {
    int slargest = secondLargest(a, n);
    int ssmallest = secondSmallest(a, n);
    return {slargest, ssmallest}; // Return both second largest and second smallest elements
}
```

## Explanation

This problem involves finding both the second largest and second smallest elements in an array. The approach is divided into two functions, `secondLargest` and `secondSmallest`, and a main function `getSecondOrderElements` that returns both values.

### Second Largest Element

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `largest` variable is initialized to the first element of the array.
   - The `slargest` variable is initialized to `-1` to handle cases where there is no second largest element.

2. **Iteration**:
   - We iterate through the array from the second element onwards.
   - If the current element is greater than `largest`, `slargest` is updated to `largest`, and `largest` is updated to the current element.
   - If the current element is smaller than `largest` but greater than `slargest`, `slargest` is updated to the current element.

3. **Return**:
   - After completing the iteration, `slargest` holds the second largest value.

### Second Smallest Element

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `smallest` variable is initialized to the first element of the array.
   - The `ssmallest` variable is initialized to `INT_MAX` to ensure it gets updated with the correct value.

2. **Iteration**:
   - We iterate through the array from the second element onwards.
   - If the current element is smaller than `smallest`, `ssmallest` is updated to `smallest`, and `smallest` is updated to the current element.
   - If the current element is greater than `smallest` but smaller than `ssmallest`, `ssmallest` is updated to the current element.

3. **Return**:
   - After completing the iteration, `ssmallest` holds the second smallest value.

### Main Function

- The `getSecondOrderElements` function calls both `secondLargest` and `secondSmallest` to get the respective values and returns them in a vector.
