## Solution

```cpp
int removeDuplicates(vector<int> &arr, int n) {
    int i = 0; // Initialize a pointer i to track the index of the last unique element

    // Iterate through the array with a pointer j
    for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        // If the current element is different from the last unique element
        if(arr[j] != arr[i]) {
            arr[i + 1] = arr[j]; // Update the next unique position with the current element
            i++; // Move the pointer i to the next unique position
        }
    }
    
    // Return the length of the array with unique elements
    return (i + 1);
}
```

## Explanation

The problem requires removing duplicates from a sorted array in place, with the constraint that the extra space used should be O(1). The solution is straightforward:

1. **Initialization**:
   - We use two pointers, `i` and `j`. The pointer `i` is used to track the position of the last unique element, while `j` is used to iterate through the array.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Start iterating with `j` from the beginning of the array.
   - For each element `arr[j]`, check if it is different from `arr[i]` (the last unique element).
   - If it is different, move `i` to the next position and copy the current element `arr[j]` to `arr[i + 1]`.

3. **Return**:
   - After completing the iteration, the array `arr` contains the unique elements in the first `i + 1` positions.
   - The function returns `i + 1`, which represents the number of unique elements in the array.

## Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: The function iterates through the array once, so the time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the array `n`.

## Space Complexity

- **O(1)**: The solution modifies the array in place and does not use any extra space, so the space complexity is constant.
