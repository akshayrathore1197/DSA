## Solution

```cpp
int consecutiveOnes(vector<int>& arr) {
    int maxi = 0;   // Variable to store the maximum count of consecutive ones
    int count = 0;  // Variable to count the current streak of ones

    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if (arr[i] == 1) {
            count++; // Increment count for consecutive ones
            maxi = max(maxi, count); // Update the maximum count if current count is greater
        } else {
            count = 0; // Reset count if a zero is encountered
        }
    }

    return maxi; // Return the maximum count of consecutive ones
}
```

## Explanation

The problem requires finding the maximum number of consecutive `1`s in a binary array. The solution follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Two variables are initialized: `maxi` to track the maximum number of consecutive `1`s and `count` to keep track of the current streak of `1`s.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Traverse through the array.
   - If the current element is `1`, increment the `count` and update `maxi` with the maximum of `maxi` and `count`.
   - If the current element is `0`, reset the `count` to `0`.

3. **Return**:
   - After the loop, `maxi` contains the maximum number of consecutive `1`s found in the array.

## Time Complexity

- **O(N)**: The solution involves a single pass through the array, where `N` is the size of the array.

## Space Complexity

- **O(1)**: The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
