## Solution

```cpp
vector<int> moveZeros(int n, vector<int> arr) {
    int j = -1;
    
    // Find the first zero in the array
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == 0) {
            j = i;  // Store the index of the first zero
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // If no zero is found, return the original array
    if (j == -1) return arr;
    
    // Traverse the array starting from the element after the first zero
    for (int i = j + 1; i < n; i++) {
        // If the current element is non-zero, swap it with the element at index 'j'
        if (arr[i] != 0) {
            swap(arr[i], arr[j++]);
        }
    }
    
    return arr;
}
```

## Explanation

The problem requires moving all zeros in an array to the end while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements. The solution follows these steps:

1. **Find the First Zero**:
   - Traverse the array to find the first zero and store its index in `j`.

2. **Handle No Zeros**:
   - If no zero is found (i.e., `j` remains `-1`), return the original array as it is already in the desired state.

3. **Move Non-Zero Elements Forward**:
   - Starting from the element after the first zero, traverse the array.
   - For every non-zero element found, swap it with the element at index `j`, and then increment `j`.

4. **Result**:
   - The modified array will have all non-zero elements at the front, and all zeros at the end.

## Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: The solution involves a single pass through the array, so the time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the array `n`.

## Space Complexity

- **O(1)**: The solution does not use any extra space other than a few variables, so the space complexity is constant.
