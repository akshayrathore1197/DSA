## Solution

```cpp
int getSingleElement(std::vector<int> &arr) {
    int num = 0; // Variable to store the XOR result

    for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        num = num ^ arr[i]; // XOR each element with num
    }

    return num; // Return the single element
}
```

## Explanation

The problem requires finding the single element in an array where every element except one appears twice. The solution utilizes the XOR operation to achieve this efficiently:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `num` to `0`. This will be used to store the XOR result of all elements in the array.

2. **XOR Operation**:
   - Traverse through the array, XORing each element with `num`.
   - The XOR operation has two key properties:
     - `a ^ a = 0` (XORing a number with itself results in zero)
     - `a ^ 0 = a` (XORing a number with zero results in the number itself)
   - By XORing all elements, the elements that appear in pairs will cancel out each other, leaving only the single element that appears once.

3. **Return**:
   - After processing all elements, `num` will hold the single element that does not have a pair.

## Time Complexity

- **O(N)**: The solution involves a single pass through the array, where `N` is the size of the array.

## Space Complexity

- **O(1)**: The solution uses a constant amount of extra space, irrespective of the input size.
