## Solution

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h> 

vector<int> findArrayIntersection(vector<int> &arr1, int n, vector<int> &arr2, int m) {
    int i = 0, j = 0; // Pointers to traverse arr1 and arr2
    vector<int> ans; // Vector to store the intersection elements

    while (i < n && j < m) {
        if (arr1[i] == arr2[j]) {
            ans.push_back(arr1[i]); // If elements are equal, add to the answer
            i++;
            j++;
        } else if (arr1[i] < arr2[j]) {
            i++; // Move pointer in arr1 forward if its element is smaller
        } else {
            j++; // Move pointer in arr2 forward if its element is smaller
        }
    }

    return ans; // Return the intersection array
}
```

## Explanation

The problem requires finding the intersection of two sorted arrays, i.e., the common elements between the two arrays. The solution is straightforward:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse `arr1` and `arr2` respectively.
   - A vector `ans` is used to store the common elements found in both arrays.

2. **Traversal**:
   - While both arrays have elements to compare, check if the elements at the current pointers are equal:
     - If equal, add the element to the intersection vector `ans` and move both pointers forward.
     - If `arr1[i]` is smaller than `arr2[j]`, move the pointer `i` forward.
     - If `arr2[j]` is smaller than `arr1[i]`, move the pointer `j` forward.

3. **Return**:
   - After the loop ends, return the `ans` vector, which contains the intersection of the two arrays.

## Time Complexity

- **O(n + m)**: The solution involves a single pass through both arrays, where `n` and `m` are the sizes of `arr1` and `arr2` respectively.

## Space Complexity

- **O(min(n, m))**: The space complexity is proportional to the size of the intersection array, which in the worst case can be the size of the smaller array.
